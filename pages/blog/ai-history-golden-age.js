                  The 1960s and 1970s marked AI's first golden age - a period of unprecedented optimism, groundbreaking research, and remarkable achievements. This era saw the creation of the first AI programs that could solve real-world problems, leading many to believe that human-level AI was just around the corner.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Rise of Expert Systems</h2>
                
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The crown jewel of this era was the development of <strong>expert systems</strong> - computer programs designed to mimic the decision-making ability of human experts in specific domains. These systems represented knowledge as rules and could reason through complex problems step by step.
                </p>

                <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 my-8">
                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">DENDRAL (1965)</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Developed at Stanford University, DENDRAL was one of the first expert systems. It could analyze mass spectrometry data to determine molecular structure, performing as well as expert chemists in many cases. This proved that machines could match human expertise in narrow domains.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">LISP: The Language of AI</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <strong>John McCarthy</strong> didn't just name AI - he also created its programming language. LISP (List Processing), developed in 1958 but flourishing in the 60s and 70s, became the dominant language for AI research.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Specialized computers designed specifically to run LISP efficiently, these machines became the workhorses of AI research labs throughout the 70s and 80s.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Breakthrough Programs</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The golden age produced several landmark AI programs that demonstrated machine intelligence in action:

                    <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">ELIZA (1966)</h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT, ELIZA was a simple natural language processing program that could engage in conversations by pattern matching and substitution. Its DOCTOR script, which mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist, was surprisingly convincing to many users.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Terry Winograd's SHRDLU could understand and execute natural language commands in a simple "blocks world." It demonstrated sophisticated language understanding and reasoning about physical objects and spatial relationships.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      This expert system diagnosed bacterial infections and recommended antibiotics. MYCIN not only performed at the level of medical experts but could also explain its reasoning - a crucial feature for medical applications.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Perceptron and Early Neural Networks</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  While symbolic AI dominated, neural network research also advanced. <strong>Frank Rosenblatt</strong> developed the Perceptron in 1957, which could learn to classify simple patterns. The excitement was immense - the New York Times reported that the Perceptron would lead to machines that could "walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence."
                </p>

                <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 my-8">
                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">The Perceptron Controversy</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published "Perceptrons," showing mathematical limitations of single-layer perceptrons. While technically correct, this book significantly dampened neural network research for nearly two decades - contributing to the first "AI Winter."

                </div>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Ambitious Goals and Grand Promises</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The success of early AI systems led to incredibly optimistic predictions. Researchers confidently predicted that:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <li>Machines with human-level intelligence would exist by 1985</li>
                  <li>Most cognitive tasks would be automated within 20 years</li>
                  <li>Universal problem solvers would be developed</li>
                  <li>Natural language understanding would be solved</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  These promises, while ultimately premature, attracted significant funding from government agencies like DARPA and private corporations, fueling rapid research expansion.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The First AI Winter Approaches</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  By the mid-1970s, the limitations of existing approaches became apparent. The <strong>combinatorial explosion</strong> problem meant that as problems grew larger, the computational requirements grew exponentially. Real-world problems proved far more complex than laboratory demonstrations.
                </p>

                <div className="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 my-8">
                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Warning Signs</h3>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Expert systems were brittle and couldn't handle unexpected situations</li>
                    <li>Natural language understanding remained superficial</li>
                    <li>Machine translation projects were failing</li>
                    <li>Computer vision was limited to highly controlled environments</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Legacy of the Golden Age</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Despite the coming winter, the golden age established crucial foundations:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>Knowledge representation</strong> techniques that are still used today</li>
                  <li><strong>Search algorithms</strong> for exploring problem spaces</li>
                  <li><strong>Expert system architectures</strong> that influenced modern AI systems</li>
                  <li><strong>Programming languages and tools</strong> designed for AI research</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Most importantly, this era demonstrated that machines could exhibit intelligent behavior in narrow domains - a insight that would eventually lead to today's powerful AI systems.
