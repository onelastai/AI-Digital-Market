                  The story of artificial intelligence begins in the 1940s and 1950s, a transformative period that laid the theoretical foundations for everything we know about AI today. This era saw brilliant minds asking fundamental questions about machine intelligence that would echo through decades of technological advancement.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Turing Foundation (1940s)</h2>
                
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <strong>Alan Turing</strong>, often called the father of computer science, made groundbreaking contributions that would become the bedrock of AI. In 1950, he published his famous paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in the journal Mind, where he posed the fundamental question: "Can machines think?"

                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">The Turing Test</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Turing proposed what became known as the "Turing Test" - a method for determining whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, human intelligence. The test involves a human evaluator judging natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  During World War II, Turing had already demonstrated the power of computational thinking by helping crack the Enigma code. His work on the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) at the National Physical Laboratory showed how machines could be programmed to perform complex calculations, setting the stage for programmable intelligence.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Birth of "Artificial Intelligence" (1950s)</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  While Turing laid the theoretical groundwork, it was <strong>John McCarthy</strong> who gave the field its name. In 1956, McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Conference, officially titled "Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence." This historic gathering is considered the founding moment of AI as an academic discipline.

                    <li><strong>Claude Shannon</strong> - Father of information theory</li>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The 1940s and 1950s were rich with theoretical innovations that would prove prophetic:

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity," describing the first mathematical model of neural networks.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Donald Hebb proposed Hebbian learning in "The Organization of Behavior," explaining how neural connections strengthen through repeated use.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Vision Takes Shape</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  These pioneers shared an audacious vision: machines that could simulate human intelligence. They believed that "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  This optimism, while perhaps naive in hindsight, drove incredible innovation. The questions they asked - about reasoning, learning, perception, and language understanding - remain central to AI research today.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The 1940s and 1950s established AI's intellectual foundation. Turing's computational theories, McCarthy's terminology and vision, and the collective optimism of the Dartmouth Conference participants created the framework for decades of AI research.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Today, as we witness the explosion of AI capabilities through large language models, computer vision, and autonomous systems, we can trace the lineage back to these pioneering thinkers who dared to ask: "What if machines could think?"
