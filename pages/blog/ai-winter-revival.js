                  The 1980s began with what became known as the first "AI Winter" - a period of reduced funding, diminished expectations, and skepticism about artificial intelligence. Yet from this challenging period emerged new approaches that would ultimately revolutionize the field: machine learning and statistical methods.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Onset of AI Winter (Early 1980s)</h2>
                
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  By 1980, the limitationsof rule-based expert systems had become painfully apparent. The British government commissioned the <strong>Lighthill Report</strong> in 1973, which was highly critical of AI research, leading to significant cuts in funding across the UK.
                </p>

                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Why AI Winter Occurred</h3>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Overpromising:</strong> Researchers had made bold predictions that didn't materialize</li>
                    <li><strong>Brittleness:</strong> Expert systems failed outside their narrow domains</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge acquisition bottleneck:</strong> Creating expert systems was expensive and time-consuming</li>
                    <li><strong>Computational limitations:</strong> Hardware wasn't powerful enough for ambitious AI goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of learning:</strong> Systems couldn't improve from experience</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Funding dried up, companies abandoned AI projects, and many researchers left the field. The term "AI" became so stigmatized that researchers began avoiding it, instead using terms like "expert systems," "knowledge-based systems," or "advanced computing."
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Quiet Revolution: Machine Learning Emerges</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  While the AI community mourned its winter, a quiet revolution was beginning. Researchers started focusing on systems that could <strong>learn from data</strong> rather than being explicitly programmed with rules.

                    <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Backpropagation Algorithm (1986)</h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      <strong>Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart, and Ronald Williams</strong> popularized the backpropagation algorithm, which enabled training of multi-layer neural networks. This breakthrough solved the XOR problem and other limitations that had plagued earlier perceptrons.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      <strong>Ross Quinlan's ID3 algorithm (1986)</strong> and later C4.5 made decision tree learning practical and interpretable. These algorithms could automatically learn rules from data, making them more flexible than hand-coded expert systems.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Building on earlier work, researchers like <strong>Richard Sutton</strong> developed temporal difference learning and Q-learning algorithms, enabling machines to learn optimal behavior through trial and error.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The 1980s saw a revival of neural network research, now called <strong>"connectionism"</strong>. The Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) research group, led by Rumelhart and McClelland, demonstrated that neural networks could learn complex patterns and even exhibit emergent behaviors.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Terry Sejnowski and Charles Rosenberg created NETtalk, a neural network that learned to pronounce English text. The system started by producing babble but gradually learned to speak clearly - demonstrating the power of learning from examples.

                  The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise of <strong>probabilistic approaches</strong> to AI. Researchers like <strong>Judea Pearl</strong> developed Bayesian networks, which could reason under uncertainty - a crucial capability that rule-based systems lacked.
