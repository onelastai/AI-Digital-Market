# MoodMirror.ai - Advanced AI Emotional Intelligence Platform

## Core Purpose & Success

- **Mission Statement**: Transform emotional well-being through accessible AI-powered emotional intelligence tools that provide personalized insights, pattern recognition, and mental health support.
- **Success Indicators**: User engagement with mood tracking, improved emotional awareness metrics, successful pattern identification, and positive user feedback on mental wellness journeys.
- **Experience Qualities**: Professional, Empowering, Intelligent

## Project Classification & Approach

- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application (multiple AI modules with advanced functionality, persistent data, specialized domains)
- **Primary User Activity**: Interacting and Creating (users actively engage with AI agents and create emotional data patterns)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

- **Core Problem Analysis**: Mental health awareness and emotional intelligence are critical but often lack accessible, personalized tools. Traditional therapy is expensive and not always available, while self-reflection tools are often generic.
- **User Context**: Users access the platform during emotional moments - both crisis and routine check-ins. They need immediate, understanding responses and long-term pattern recognition.
- **Critical Path**: Home → Module Selection → AI Interaction → Insight Generation → Long-term Pattern Recognition
- **Key Moments**: First mood analysis (instant emotional validation), weekly summary generation (pattern recognition breakthrough), crisis support detection (immediate help routing)

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with warm empathy - users should feel both supported and taken seriously
- **Design Personality**: Modern, sophisticated, and calming with subtle technological advancement hints
- **Visual Metaphors**: Crystal clarity (for insight), neural networks (for AI intelligence), gradients (for emotional spectrum)
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean minimalism with purposeful complexity - sophisticated enough for professional use, simple enough for emotional moments

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent highlights (deep blues to cyans with warm accent colors)
- **Primary Color**: Deep sophisticated blue (oklch(0.45 0.25 240)) - represents trust, stability, intelligence
- **Secondary Colors**: Complementary blue-purple tones for depth and sophistication
- **Accent Color**: Warm cyan (oklch(0.78 0.18 195)) - represents insight, clarity, breakthrough moments
- **Color Psychology**: Blue evokes trust and calm, cyan suggests clarity and breakthrough, warm accents provide human connection
- **Color Accessibility**: All combinations exceed WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum contrast)
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (oklch(0.12 0.08 240)) + Foreground (oklch(0.98 0 0)) = 14.2:1 contrast ✓
  - Primary (oklch(0.45 0.25 240)) + Primary-foreground (oklch(0.98 0 0)) = 9.8:1 contrast ✓
  - Accent (oklch(0.78 0.18 195)) + Accent-foreground (oklch(0.15 0 0)) = 16.4:1 contrast ✓

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI (clean, professional, highly legible), JetBrains Mono for technical elements
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear scale from hero (4xl) to body (base) with consistent line heights (1.6 for readability)
- **Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism and accessibility
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing, optimal line lengths (60-70 characters), high contrast
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent font-weight usage (400 normal, 500 medium, 600 semibold, 700 bold)
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) for all UI text, JetBrains Mono for code/technical content
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts tested for accessibility and emotional comfort during difficult moments ✓

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Hero section draws attention to core value, then guides to module selection, finally to specific interactions
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates calm, reduces cognitive load during emotional processing
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid with consistent gaps and responsive breakpoints
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- **Content Density**: Balanced - enough information to feel comprehensive, enough space to feel calm

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle particles suggest neural activity/thought processes, gentle transitions convey care and attention
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Hero elements have gentle movement, interactive elements respond immediately, background elements are subtle
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Calming animations during emotional analysis, celebratory for insights, minimal during crisis moments

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Shadcn/ui cards for module containers, buttons with clear hierarchy, form elements with validation states
- **Component Customization**: Glass morphism effects, custom gradients, enhanced focus states for accessibility
- **Component States**: Clear hover, focus, active, and disabled states with appropriate feedback
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons - clean, consistent, with both outline and filled variations for hierarchy
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons for main actions, secondary for navigation, tertiary for additional options
- **Spacing System**: Consistent Tailwind spacing scale (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24px) for predictable rhythm
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-first design with 44px minimum touch targets, simplified navigation

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with consistent props and styling patterns
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color tokens, typography scale, spacing system, component states
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card layouts, predictable information architecture
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional medical/wellness industry standards with modern AI positioning

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AAA compliance (7:1) for critical text, AA minimum (4.5:1) for all other content
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators, logical tab order, keyboard navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic markup, ARIA labels, descriptive alt text
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion for users with vestibular disorders

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

- **Crisis Detection**: AI identifies concerning language and provides appropriate resources/emergency contacts
- **Data Loss**: Local-first storage with optional cloud backup prevents data loss
- **Offline Usage**: Core mood tracking functionality works offline with sync when connection returns
- **Privacy Concerns**: Clear data handling policies, local storage by default, user control over data sharing
- **Emotional Overwhelm**: Simple exit strategies, crisis resources, option to pause tracking
- **Analysis Accuracy**: Confidence scoring, human oversight options, user feedback loops for improvement

## Implementation Considerations

- **Scalability Needs**: Modular architecture allows independent scaling of AI services
- **Testing Focus**: Emotion detection accuracy, user experience during vulnerable moments, accessibility compliance
- **Critical Questions**: How do we balance AI insights with human empathy? How do we ensure user safety during crisis moments?
- **Performance**: Optimize for emotional moments - fast loading, reliable responses, graceful degradation
